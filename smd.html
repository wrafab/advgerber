<b>Surface Mount Devices</b>
<p>Surface mount devices are mounted directly to the printed circuit board as opposed to through hole soldering.  Surface mount printed circuit boards are easier to create, but harder 
to solder.   They use liquid flux and contray to through hole, use solder directly from the tip of the soldering iron.   SMD's come in different sizing and identifying polarity can be confusing.  The best 
way to learn SMD soldering is to practice.  You may need to use the microscope to place the components on the board.  </p>

<p>
Your task is to solder the practice board and try to get the lights to illuminate.  Take a picture of the completed practice board and then describe the process of surface mount soldering in contrast to 
through hole soldering.   Which method do you prefer?
